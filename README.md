# Leeds-footfall-forecasting

Self-initiate project starts 25 Oct 2020

Background: 
Leeds is a city in UK where my university is located where I spent a year pursuing my Msc degree.
It has many of my great memories in this beautiful city. So yeah, my next project is going to be doing some studies of the city.

### Data Set:
https://data.gov.uk/dataset/dec652ac-2c1c-4494-bf90-87dbdf790fec/leeds-city-centre-footfall-data

The **Leeds city centre footfall data set** consists of hourly footfall data around the city centre captured by 8 cameras.
I am going to take 4 years of data from 2010-2013, with the objectives of:
1. Doing some visualisation and analysis on the footfall data using Tableau
2. Apply time-series forecasting for the prediction.

Ps: I wished to choose the most recent data but unfortunately there were some serious missing data in the nearest year.
