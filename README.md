# Leeds-footfall-forecasting

Self-initiate project starts 25 Oct 2020

Background: 
Leeds is a city in UK where my university is located where I spent a year pursuing my Msc degree.
It has many of my great memories in this beautiful city. So yeah, my next project is going to be some study of the city.

### Data Set:
https://data.gov.uk/dataset/dec652ac-2c1c-4494-bf90-87dbdf790fec/leeds-city-centre-footfall-data

The **Leeds city centre footfall data set** consists of hourly footfall data around the city centre captured by 6 cameras.
I am going to take 5 years of data from 2015-2019, with the objectives of:
1. Doing some visualisation and analysis on the footfall data using Tableau
2. Apply time-series forecasting for the prediction.
