# Leeds-footfall-forecasting


Background: 
Leeds is a city in UK where my university is located where I spent a year pursuing my Msc degree.
It has many of my great memories in this beautiful city. So yeah, my next project is going to be doing some studies of the city.

### Data Set:

**For instance in year 2018 , Jan - March has only daily data while the rest are in hourly. 
Oct data are actually Sept data (That is a missing in Oct and duplicate at Sept)**

**The barchart above shows the count of record in 2010-2013. Clearly it has a better data quality within within the year**

The **Leeds city centre footfall data set** consists of hourly footfall data around the city centre captured by 8 cameras.
I am going to take 4 years of data from 2010-2013, with the objectives of:
1. Doing some visualisation and analysis on the footfall data using Tableau
2. Apply time-series forecasting for the prediction.

Ps: I wished to choose the most recent data but unfortunately there were some serious missing data in the nearest year.
